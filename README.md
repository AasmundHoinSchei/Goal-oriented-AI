# SmartObject AI template for UnrealEngine 5
SmartObject AI template for UnrealEngine 5


This is a project intended to make a AI that can select goals based on its current situation. Its heavly inspired by F.E.A.R.s goal oriented action planning AI
system. It uses smart object actors that you can place out in the level and make it play different animations or tweak the code to do other interesting stuff.



# Known bugs:

Animations is out of bounds message is normal
AI using smart object actor triggers animations multiple times
Floor material needs re-adjusting, use these values: U tiling: -33,184689 V tiling: âˆ’38,202377






# This is now ported to UE5. The new StateTree AI system is super experimental, so use at your own risk!
