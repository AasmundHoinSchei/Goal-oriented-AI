# Smart object AI template for UnrealEngine 5
Smart object AI template for UnrealEngine 5


This is a project intended to make a AI that can select goals based on its current situation. Its heavly inspired by F.E.A.R.s goal oriented action planning AI
system. It uses smart object actors to trigger events like playing a animation. This can be tweaked into more interesting stuff for different use cases.
