# SmartObject AI template for UnrealEngine 5
SmartObject AI template for UnrealEngine 5


This is a project intended to make a AI that can select goals based on its current situation. Its heavly inspired by F.E.A.R.s goal oriented action planning AI
system. It uses smart object actors to trigger events like playing a animation. This can be tweaked into more interesting stuff for different use cases.

# Known bugs:

* Animations out of bounds message is normal
* AI using smart object actor triggers animations multiple times
* Floor material needs re-adjusting, use these values: U tiling: -33,184689 V tiling: âˆ’38,202377 (In the text coord node)






# This is now ported to UE5. The new StateTree AI system is super experimental, so use at your own risk!
