# Goal-oriented-AI
Goal oriented AI template for UnrealEngine


This is a project intended to make a AI that can select goals based on its current situation. Its heavly inspired by F.E.A.R.s goal oriented action planning AI
system. Dont expect any superfancy stuff on my project yet as it eventually gonna get updated during the progress. You can have a look at the goal switching on my Twitter account:
